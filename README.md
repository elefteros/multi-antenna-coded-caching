# multi-antenna-coded-caching
The code to realise the results of paper "Bridging the Gap between Multiplexing and Diversity in Finite SNR Multiple Antenna Coded Caching".

The main allows the selection of the parameters L, K\gamma.

Computing takes place for all different streams i.e., s=\{1,2,..., L\}
